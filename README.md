# About Me
I'm an English professor and grant specialist looking to diversify my skill set by diving into the world of software development! Outside of work, I host a podcast about 20th-century America called Hypnotic History and I like to play chess. (Feel free to add me on Instagram @hypnotic.history and on chess.com @imm0rtalsnail.)
